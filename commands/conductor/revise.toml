## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE
You are an AI agent for the Conductor framework. Your task is to update specifications and plans when implementation reveals issues, requirements change, or scope adjustments are needed.

CRITICAL: You must validate the success of every tool call. If any tool call fails, you MUST halt immediately, announce the failure, and await instructions.

---

## 1. Identify Track
- Find active track (marked `[~]` in tracks.md)
- If no active track, ask which track to revise
- Check for `parallel_state.json` (parallel execution in progress)

## 1a. Parallel Execution Check

If `parallel_state.json` exists:
> "⚠️ This track has parallel workers currently running."
> "Revising the plan may affect in-progress workers."
> 
> "A) Wait for workers to complete, then revise"
> "B) Revise now (affected workers may need restart)"
> "C) Cancel revision"

- If A: Monitor until complete, then proceed
- If B: Note affected tasks in revision, workers operating on changed tasks should abort
- If C: HALT

## 2. Determine Revision Type
Ask what needs revision:
1. **Spec** - Requirements changed or misunderstood
2. **Plan** - Tasks need to be added, removed, or modified
3. **Both** - Significant scope change

## 3. Gather Context
Ask targeted questions about what was discovered and what needs to change.

## 4. Create Revision Record
Append to `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/revisions.md`:
- Revision number, date, type
- What triggered the revision
- Current phase/task when revision occurred
- Changes made (spec and/or plan)
- Rationale and impact

## 5. Update Documents
- Update `spec.md` and/or `plan.md` as needed
- Add "Last Revised" marker at top of updated files
- New tasks: `[ ]`, Removed tasks: `[-] [REMOVED: reason]`
- **Phase-level parallel changes:**
  - Add/modify `<!-- depends: -->` annotations for phase dependencies
  - Add/modify `<!-- depends: phase1, phase2 -->` for specific phase dependencies
  - If removing a phase that others depend on, update dependent phases
- **Task-level parallel changes:**
  - Update `<!-- files: ... -->` and `<!-- depends: ... -->` annotations
  - If parallel phase removed: Mark for sequential execution or update annotations

## 6. Commit
```bash
git add conductor/tracks/<track_id>/
git commit -m "conductor(revise): Update spec/plan for <track_id>"
```

## 7. Announce
Report what was revised and suggest `/conductor:implement` to continue.

## 7a. LOG REVISION AS LEARNING

**PROTOCOL: Record revisions as learnings for future tracks (Ralph-style gotcha tracking).**

Revisions are valuable learnings - they indicate gaps in initial understanding.

1. **Append to `learnings.md`:**
   ```markdown
   ## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - REVISION #N
   - **Type:** Spec/Plan/Both
   - **Trigger:** <what triggered the revision during implementation>
   - **Learning:**
     - Gotcha: <what was missed or misunderstood>
     - Pattern: <how to avoid this in future>
   ---
   ```

2. **Flag for Pattern Elevation:**
   - If revision reveals a pattern applicable to future tracks, offer to add to `conductor/patterns.md`

---

## 8. BEADS SYNC

**PROTOCOL: Sync revisions with Beads.**

1. **Check for Beads CLI:**
   - Run `which bd`
   - **If NOT found:**
     > "⚠️ Beads CLI (`bd`) is not installed. Beads provides persistent task memory across sessions."
     > "A) Continue without Beads sync"
     > "B) Stop - I'll install Beads first"
     - If A: Skip this section
     - If B: HALT and wait for user

2. **Sync Task Changes:**
   - NEW tasks: 
     ```bash
     bd create "<task>" --parent <phase_id> \
       --design "<task technical notes>" \
       --acceptance "<task done criteria>" \
       --json
     ```
   - REMOVED tasks: `bd close <task_id> --reason "Removed in revision #N: <reason>"`
   - MODIFIED tasks: `bd update <task_id> --notes "REVISED: <what changed and why>"`
   - **If any `bd` command fails:**
     > "⚠️ Beads command failed: <error message>"
     > "A) Continue without Beads sync"
     > "B) Retry the failed command"
     > "C) Stop - I'll fix the issue first"
     - If A: Skip remaining Beads steps
     - If B: Retry the command
     - If C: HALT and wait for user

3. **Add Revision Note to Epic:**
   ```bash
   bd update <epic_id> --notes "REVISION #N: <summary of changes>
   REASON: <why revision was needed>
   IMPACT: +X tasks added, -Y tasks removed, ~Z modified
   KEY DECISION: <if any major decisions made during revision>"
   ```

4. **Parallel Execution Changes (if parallel annotations modified):**
   
   **Phase-Level Dependencies:**
   - If phase `<!-- depends: -->` annotations changed:
     - For phases with NEW dependencies: `bd dep add <phase_id> <dependency_phase_id>`
     - For phases with REMOVED dependencies: Update epic notes to reflect new structure
     - For phases changed to `<!-- depends: -->` (empty - no dependencies):
       - Remove all phase-level dependencies in Beads for this phase
   
   **Task-Level Parallel Config:**
   - For NEW parallel tasks: Add file ownership notes:
     ```bash
     bd update <new_task_id> --notes "PARALLEL_ENABLED: true
     FILES_OWNED: <comma-separated file list>
     DEPENDS_ON: <task dependencies>" --json
     ```
   - For MODIFIED parallel annotations (files/depends changed):
     ```bash
     bd update <task_id> --notes "REVISED: Parallel config changed
     FILES_OWNED: <new file list>
     DEPENDS_ON: <new dependencies>" --json
     ```
   - If parallel phase changed to sequential (or vice versa):
     - Clear/set `PARALLEL_ENABLED` in task notes
     - Clear assignees if reverting to sequential: `bd update <id> --assignee "" --json`
