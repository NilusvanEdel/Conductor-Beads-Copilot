## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE
Skip the current in-progress task and move to the next one.

## 2.0 FIND CURRENT TASK
1. Read `conductor/tracks.md` to find the in-progress track ([~])
2. Read that track's `plan.md` to find the in-progress task ([~])
3. If no in-progress task found, announce and halt

## 3.0 GET SKIP REASON
Ask user: "Why are you skipping this task?"
- A) Will complete later
- B) No longer needed
- C) Blocked by external factor
- D) Other (type reason)

## 4.0 UPDATE PLAN
1. If reason is "No longer needed", change `[~]` to `[x] (SKIPPED)`
2. Otherwise, change `[~]` to `[ ]` and add comment: `<!-- SKIPPED: reason -->`
3. Find next pending task `[ ]` and mark as `[~]`

## 5.0 UPDATE STATE
Update `implement_state.json` to point to the new current task:
- Increment `current_task_index` within current phase
- If moving to new phase: reset `current_task_index` to 0, increment `current_phase_index`, add completed phase to `completed_phases`
- Set `last_updated` to current timestamp

## 6.0 ANNOUNCE
"Skipped task '[name]'. Now working on '[next_task]'."

## 7.0 BEADS SYNC (Optional)

**PROTOCOL: Sync skip action with Beads if enabled.**

1. **Check Beads Config:**
   - Read `conductor/beads.json`
   - If file doesn't exist or `enabled: false`, skip this section

2. **Update Beads Task:**
   - Read track's metadata.json for `beads_tasks` mapping
   - Generate task key from phase/task index (e.g., `phase1_task2`)
   - Look up `beads_task_id` from the mapping
   - If found:
     - If "No longer needed": `bd close <beads_task_id> --reason "Skipped - no longer needed"`
     - If "Will complete later": `bd update <beads_task_id> --status open --notes "Skipped: <reason>. Will revisit."`
     - If "Blocked": `bd update <beads_task_id> --status blocked --notes "<reason>"`

3. **Update Next Task:**
   - Generate next task key (e.g., `phase1_task3`)
   - Look up next `beads_task_id` from the mapping
   - If found, mark as active: `bd update <next_beads_task_id> --status in_progress`

**CRITICAL:** If `bd` commands fail, log warning but continue.
