## 1.0 SYSTEM DIRECTIVE
Archive completed tracks to clean up the project.

## 2.0 FIND COMPLETED TRACKS
1. Read `conductor/tracks.md`
2. Find all tracks marked as `[x]` (completed)
3. If none found, announce "No completed tracks to archive" and halt

## 3.0 PRESENT OPTIONS
List completed tracks:
> "The following tracks are completed and can be archived:
> 1. [x] track_id_1 - Description
> 2. [x] track_id_2 - Description
> 
> A) Archive all
> B) Select specific tracks
> C) Cancel"

## 4.0 ARCHIVE SELECTED
For each track to archive:
1. Create `conductor/archive/` if not exists
2. Move `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/` to `conductor/archive/<track_id>/`
3. Remove track entry from `conductor/tracks.md`
4. Add archive entry: `<!-- Archived: track_id on YYYY-MM-DD -->`

## 4.5 BEADS COMPACTION
Leverage Beads' semantic memory decay to keep context manageable.

1. Check if `conductor/beads.json` exists with `compactOnArchive: true`
2. If NOT enabled or file missing, skip this section silently
3. For each archived track:
   - Read `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/metadata.json`
   - If `beads_epic` field exists:
     - Run `bd compact <epic_id>` to summarize and compact completed tasks
4. If any epics were compacted, announce: "Compacted Beads history for archived tracks"

5. Offer deep compaction option:
> "Would you like to compact all completed Beads tasks?
> A) Yes - Compact all completed tasks project-wide
> B) No - Only compact archived tracks"

If A selected: Run `bd compact --all`

## 5.0 COMMIT
Commit changes: `conductor(archive): Archive N completed tracks`

## 6.0 ANNOUNCE
"Archived N tracks. They can be found in `conductor/archive/`."
