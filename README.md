# Conductor-Beads

**Measure twice, code once.**

A unified toolkit for **Context-Driven Development** that combines structured planning with persistent memory. Turn your AI assistant into a proactive project manager that follows a strict protocol: **Context → Spec & Plan → Implement**.

**Version:** 0.1.0

## What is Conductor-Beads?

Conductor-Beads integrates two powerful systems:

- **Conductor** provides the methodology — specs, plans, tracks, and TDD workflows
- **Beads** provides the memory — persistent task tracking that survives conversation compaction

Together, they enable AI agents to manage long-horizon development tasks without losing context across sessions.

## Supported Platforms

- **Gemini CLI** - via extension commands (TOML)
- **Claude Code** - via slash commands and skills
- **Agent Skills compatible CLIs** - via skills specification

---

## Prerequisites

### Install Beads (Required for persistent memory)

Beads provides persistent, structured memory for coding agents. Install using one of these methods:

```bash
# npm (recommended)
npm install -g @beads/bd

# Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install steveyegge/beads/bd

# Go
go install github.com/steveyegge/beads/cmd/bd@latest
```

Verify installation:
```bash
bd --version
```

> **Note:** Beads is optional but highly recommended. Conductor works standalone, but loses cross-session memory without Beads.

## Installation

### Claude Code

**Full Installation** (all skills):
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/NguyenSiTrung/Conductor-Beads.git

# Copy commands and skills to your global config
cp -r Conductor-Beads/.claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
cp -r Conductor-Beads/.claude/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Minimal Installation** (conductor only, smaller context):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NguyenSiTrung/Conductor-Beads.git

# Copy only commands and conductor skill
cp -r Conductor-Beads/.claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r Conductor-Beads/.claude/skills/conductor ~/.claude/skills/
```

**Project-Local Installation**:
```bash
# Full - copy entire .claude folder
cp -r Conductor-Beads/.claude your-project/

# Minimal - conductor only
mkdir -p your-project/.claude/skills
cp -r Conductor-Beads/.claude/commands your-project/.claude/
cp -r Conductor-Beads/.claude/skills/conductor your-project/.claude/skills/
```

| Installation | Includes | Best For |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Full** | conductor, beads, skill-creator skills | Standalone Beads usage, skill development |
| **Minimal** | conductor skill only (has Beads integration) | Most projects, smaller context window |

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/NguyenSiTrung/Conductor-Beads --auto-update
```

---

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Run the setup command in your project directory:

```bash
# Claude Code
/conductor-setup

# Gemini CLI
/conductor:setup
```

This creates the `conductor/` directory with:
- `product.md` - Product vision and goals
- `tech-stack.md` - Technology choices
- `workflow.md` - Development standards (TDD, commits)
- `tracks.md` - Master track list

### Step 2: Initialize Beads (Recommended)

After Conductor setup, initialize Beads for persistent memory:

```bash
# Standard mode (commits to repo)
bd init

# Stealth mode (local-only, for shared repos)
bd init --stealth
```

This creates `.beads/` directory for dependency-aware task tracking.

### Step 3: Configuration

After setup, `conductor/beads.json` controls integration:
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "mode": "stealth",
  "sync": "bidirectional",
  "compactOnArchive": true
}
```

**Mode Options:**

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `"normal"` | `bd init` | Full integration. Commits `.beads/` to repo. Team members see tasks. |
| `"stealth"` | `bd init --stealth` | Local only. `.beads/` is gitignored. Personal use on shared repos. |

Use **stealth** when working on a shared repository where you don't want to commit Beads data. Use **normal** when the whole team uses Beads.

## Implementation Guide

### Creating a New Track

```bash
# Claude Code
/conductor-newtrack "Add user authentication"

# Gemini CLI
/conductor:newTrack "Add user authentication"
```

This creates:
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/spec.md` - Requirements
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/plan.md` - Phased task list
- `conductor/tracks/<track_id>/metadata.json` - Track metadata
- Beads epic (if enabled): `bd-xxxx`

### Implementing a Track

```bash
# Claude Code
/conductor-implement

# Gemini CLI
/conductor:implement
```

The workflow:
1. **Load context** - Reads spec.md and plan.md
2. **Find ready tasks** - Uses `bd ready` if Beads enabled
3. **Execute TDD** - Write test → Implement → Refactor
4. **Track progress** - Updates plan.md and Beads status
5. **Verify** - Manual verification at phase boundaries

### Checking Status

```bash
# Claude Code
/conductor-status

# Gemini CLI
/conductor:status
```

Shows:
- Active tracks with progress
- Ready tasks (from Beads)
- Blocked items

## Skills

Located in `.claude/skills/`:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **conductor** | Context-driven development methodology. Auto-activates when `conductor/` directory exists. Provides intent mapping for natural language commands. |
| **beads** | Persistent task memory that survives conversation compaction. Auto-activates when `.beads/` directory exists. Integrates with Conductor for cross-session memory. |
| **skill-creator** | Guide for creating and packaging new AI agent skills. |

### How Skills Work

Skills auto-activate based on project structure:
- `conductor/` directory → Conductor skill loads
- `.beads/` directory → Beads skill loads
- Both present → Integrated workflow enabled

Skills provide:
- **Context Loading**: Automatically reads relevant project files
- **Intent Mapping**: Converts natural language to commands
- **Proactive Behaviors**: Suggests next steps and detects issues

### Quick Reference Patterns

| Pattern | Command Flow |
|---------|--------------|
| **Happy Path** | `setup` → `bd init` → `newtrack` → `implement` → `archive` |
| **Multi-Section** | `implement` → *(5+ tasks)* → `handoff` → *(new session)* → `implement` |
| **Handle Blockers** | `implement` → `block` → `skip` or wait → `implement` |
| **Mid-Track Changes** | `implement` → `revise` → `implement` |
| **Session Resume** | `bd ready` → `bd show --notes` → load spec → `implement` |
| **Monitoring** | `status` / `validate` *(anytime)* |
| **Context Drift** | `refresh` *(when codebase changed outside Conductor)* |
